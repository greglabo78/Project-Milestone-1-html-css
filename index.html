                    The first thing is obviously the natural beauty of the country. 
                    Even though many people think of Japan as a highly modern country with flashy neon lights and advanced technology, shopping malls and high-end stores, there are many ways in which Japan is a nature lover’s paradise! 
                    As soon as you travel outside of the big and modern cities you will discover that the country is home to some of the best natural scenery in the world. 
                    From the wilderness in Hokkaido to the white pristine beaches of Okinawa, Japan’s nature  is incredibly diverse. 
                    The rugged mountains, rocky coastlines, pristine white beaches, bamboo forests and some of the world’s most beautiful waterfalls are just some of the natural beauty to be enjoyed all year round.

                <h2>Mount Fuji  <i class="fas fa-mountain"></i> </h2>

                <p>
                    Mount Fuji is famous all over the world as a place to visit during any season of the year. 
                    But the majestic Fujisan is not ‘just a mountain’ as it takes a very special, sacred place in the Japanese culture. 
                    Since the 7th century it has been a sacred site for Shintoism, the indigenous religion of Japan. 
                    Japanese people have always held Mount Fuji close to their heart and Mount Fuji is displayed in many artistic outings, including (ancient) pottery, calligraphy, ukiyo-e paintings and woodblock prints. 
                    Climbing Mount Fuji is at the top of many people’s bucket list and an estimated 400,000 people climb the volcano each year. 
                    The climbing season of the highest peak (3,776 m) in Japan lasts from early July to early September. 
                    Though, even if you are not keen on making your way to the summit, Mount Fuji is a sight to behold.

                    Japan is amongst the safest countries in the world, with an extremely low crime rate. 
                    This is something the Japanese are, understandably, quite proud of. 
                    Japanese people often leave their doors unlocked, children are perfectly safe traveling on the subway by themselves, and visitors are able to walk around the cities at night without having to worry. 
                    Japan’s low crime rate is partly due to the cultural belief in Japan where they always prioritize the common good above their own needs. 
                    You will likely come across some situations that you might think of as dangerous or stupid behaviour, but are perfectly normal in Japan. 
                    Japan is so safe, you can fall asleep on the train in Tokyo, the world’s biggest city, and wake up with your wallet and phone still in your possession. 
                    Or even on the street, you might see some salaryman passed out after 1 or 2 drinks too many but they won’t be robbed of their valuables. 
                    When you do forget something in a restaurant or on the train, always try to go back, it is highly likely that someone kept it for you or brought it to the police!

                    Even though Japanese cuisine is available around the world, the country attracts millions of tourists every year just to experience authentic Japanese food. 
                    Some of the usual experiences are the sushi conveyor belt and sake bars and don’t forget to try some fresh sushi at Tsukiji Fish Market or the delicious street food like takoyaki in Osaka. 
                    For many visitors, a trip to Japan provides the opportunity to indulge in some authentic Kaiseki food. 
                    Kaiseki is a traditional form of cuisine that has evolved over a period of thousands of years, using ingredients that are hardly found in any other part of the world. 
                    Any random, shady looking place makes the best sushi, ramen or tempura. Even the konbini food is tasty and freshly prepared on a daily basis. 
                    Tokyo has more Michelin stars than any other city in the world, with also the most three-star restaurants (12) in the world! 
                    Add to it a variety of traditional Japanese drinks and you have an experience of a lifetime waiting for you!
